# summary-my-day


I messaged someone for an interview and asked about their availability, but I haven't received a response from them yet. They also haven't joined the Microsoft Teams group. I reached out to a coworker and asked her about her grade, but she said she doesn't know. I suggested that she could check her offer letter, which can be found in her Gmail account â€“ the one she provided to the company during the application process. I'm eagerly awaiting her reply. Furthermore, I inquired about the process of conducting the interview, and I was informed that I should connect with another coworker for guidance.
